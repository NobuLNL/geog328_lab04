**Lab 4**

In my Lab 4, I decided to use the cases per 10k attribute from the geojson that we were provided. I adjusted my steps and legend to properly represent values up to 10000. Additionally, I modified the size of the map overlay to prevent text overflow during hover and changed the overlay to static as the scroll option didn't consistently work. I opted to maintain the same colors for the choropleth as they aligned with my intended representation of cases.
